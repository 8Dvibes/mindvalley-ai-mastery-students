## Template: Reservation (WhatsApp)

Hi [Guest Name]! Lovely — congratulations 🎉

We’re fully booked for 8:30 PM on [date] for a party of [size]. We can offer 6:30 PM instead (table back by 8:30). Would you like me to reserve it? If you prefer, I can add you to the waitlist and message you if anything opens.

If yes — please share a contact number. Thank you!

## Example — Sample 1 (rewritten)

Hi — congratulations! 🎉

We’re full at 8:30 this Saturday for 10, but can do 6:30 (we’d need the table back by 8:30). Shall I reserve 6:30 or add you to the waitlist?

## Template: Reservation (Gmail)

Subject: Reservation for [date] — party of [size]

Hello [Guest Name],

Thank you so much for thinking of Palapa for your celebration — congratulations on the birthdays and engagement!

I’m sorry to say that we are fully booked for an 8:30 PM table on [date] for a party of [size]. The best option we can offer this evening is a reservation at 6:30 PM; if you choose this time we would kindly ask that the table be available until 8:30 PM to accommodate another booking.

If 6:30 PM suits your group, I will reserve our best table for you. If you prefer to wait for an 8:30 opening, I can add you to our waiting list and contact you if a table becomes available. Alternatively, you may tell us whether you’d prefer an al‑fresco table by the lagoon or a quieter tucked‑away spot, and we’ll do our best to accommodate your preference.

Please confirm which option you prefer and a contact telephone number we can use for confirmation.

We’re looking forward to welcoming you to a magical evening under the palms.

Warm regards,
The Palapa Hidden Oasis Team

## Example — Sample 1 (rewritten)

Subject: Reservation for Saturday 6th — party of 10

Hello — and many congratulations on the celebrations!

Thank you so much for choosing Palapa to celebrate these special moments. We’re delighted you thought of us.

At present we’re fully booked for an 8:30 PM table this Saturday for a party of ten. The best alternative we can offer is a 6:30 PM reservation the same evening; we would kindly ask that the table be returned by 8:30 PM to accommodate a later booking.

If 6:30 PM works for you, I’ll reserve our finest table and note any seating preference (al‑fresco by the lagoon, or a quieter tucked‑away spot). If you’d prefer to wait for an 8:30 opening, I can add you to the waiting list and contact you immediately should a table free up.

Please let me know which option you’d prefer and a contact number for confirmation.

We’re looking forward to welcoming you to a lovely evening under the palms.

Warm regards,
The Palapa Hidden Oasis Team

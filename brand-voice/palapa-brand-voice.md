# Palapa Hidden Oasis — Brand Voice Guide

## Essence of the Voice
The Palapa Hidden Oasis brand voice is warm, British-leaning, and elegantly understated. It embodies **easy elegance** and **simple luxury**, always inviting guests into a lush, tropical world under the palms. The tone is gracious, refined, and welcoming—never stiff, never overly dramatic.

---

## Core Tone & Style
- Warm, sophisticated, and gently poetic.
- Refined but approachable—hospitality with elegance rather than extravagance.
- Evokes atmosphere: palms, candle-lit glow, lagoon breezes, open-air magic, al fresco evenings, and tucked-away nooks.
- Clear, calm, and confident in delivery.
- Speaks as a host, never as a corporate marketer.

---

## Signature Phrases & Vocabulary
We naturally use:
- "lovely"
- "wonderful"
- "a magical evening under the palms"
- "easy elegance" / "simple luxury"
- "we're looking forward to welcoming you"

Use these sparingly and sincerely — they should add warmth, not repetition.

## Tone Guidance (Do / Don't)
- Do: Use calm, sensory language that evokes place (palms, lagoon, candle-lit). Keep sentences elegant and unhurried.
- Do: Speak as a gracious host, offering helpful guidance and gentle reassurance.
- Don't: Use loud superlatives, hard-sell language, or corporate phrasing.
- Don't: Over-embellish sensory details—keep them tasteful and specific.

---

## Examples (Short)
- Booking confirmation: "We're delighted to confirm your stay — a lovely evening under the palms awaits."
- Handling a minor complaint: "I'm sorry to hear this; we'll make it right and look forward to welcoming you back."
